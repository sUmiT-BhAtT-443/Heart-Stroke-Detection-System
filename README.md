# 🧠 Heart Stroke Detection System

A machine learning–based web application that predicts stroke risk based on user health information.  
The project focuses on **practical healthcare decision-making**, handling **imbalanced data**, and providing a **probability-based risk score** instead of a simple yes/no result.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Heart Stroke Detection System allows users to enter basic health and lifestyle details such as:
- Age group
- Blood pressure condition
- Heart disease status
- Glucose level
- BMI
- Smoking habits
- Work and residence type

Based on these inputs, the system predicts the **stroke risk level** along with a **risk percentage**, helping users understand how risky the situation might be.

The application is built using **Machine Learning + Streamlit** and is deployed as a **live web dashboard**.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🖥️ Interactive and user-friendly dashboard
- 🧪 Machine learning–based prediction
- 📊 Probability-based risk score
- ⚖️ Handles imbalanced healthcare data
- 🚫 No pre-filled inputs (real user interaction)
- 🌐 Deployed as a live web application

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Dataset:** Healthcare Stroke Dataset  
- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification (Stroke / No Stroke)
- **Challenge:** Highly imbalanced data (stroke cases are rare)

### Model Used
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- Class imbalance handled during training
- Probability-based thresholding used for safer predictions

### Why Random Forest?
- Works well with mixed features
- Captures non-linear relationships
- More reliable for healthcare risk prediction

Instead of only relying on accuracy, the model focuses on **recall and safety**, ensuring that high-risk cases are not missed.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing & EDA

- Removed unnecessary columns
- Handled missing values (BMI)
- Encoded categorical features
- Grouped age into meaningful ranges
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand:
  - Age vs stroke relationship
  - Impact of glucose level, hypertension, and heart disease
  - Lifestyle patterns affecting stroke risk
